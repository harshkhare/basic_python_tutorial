# Let's use some numbers.

# Question 1:
# Find approximate distance from Berlin to the North pole of the Earth :)
# Tip:
# You can use the expression-
# s = r * theta
# where,
# 's' is the arc length
# 'r' is the radius of the circle
# 'theta' is the angle (in radians) which this arc subtends at the center of the circle
#
# Here's a starter to get you going.
# Latitude of Berlin is approx. 52.52 degrees North.
# Assume that Earth's radius is 6400 km.
# You need to find the arc length from Berlin to the North pole.
# Remember to convert degrees to radians.
# One more thing to remember: Give meaningful names to the variables.

earthRadius = 6400
pi = 22/7

# Now do the rest of the calculation.
# Try to print your answer as follows-
"""
The distance to the North pole from Berlin is ??? km.
"""
# '???' will be replaced by the distance value.

# Question 2:
# Once you are done with the Question 1, find out the approximate circumference of the Earth.

# Question 3 (OPTIONAL):
# If you really have more time, then calculate distance between Berlin and Mumbai.
# You might have to spend quite some time doing the geometry for this :)
# Anyway, this question is not essential to understand numeric data types in Python.
