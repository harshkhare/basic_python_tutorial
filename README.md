Programming can be very rewarding when it serves our purpose.
For many beginners in coding, learning commands or even writing commands for standard text book questions becomes boring.
For most, it is only then the coding becomes interesting when they use it to solve their own problems.
But to get there, there is some road to travel- learning to code and learning to know how computer works.
Availability of diverse tutorials to solve is one of the ways to make this road more interesting.
This was one such effort to make coding interesting for one of my friends who is a mathematician and wanted to begin coding for her studies.
It appeared that these assignments, while being light, were able to kindle her interest in practical programming without being overwhelming.

This repository provides a set of assignments for a very basic introduction to Python programming.
It does not teach each and every aspect of Python programming, but it gives simple questions to solve along with some quick information.
It expects that the user will find out from other resources regarding the coding language and the syntax.

It should also be noted that these assignments were meant for supervised introduction to Python so the explanations may not be complete in all cases.
The assignments themselves do not aim to provide full Python course that can be learned indepently.
It is a mere collection of assignments that may make the topic interesting for beginners.

Below are some other online resources that I recommend for understanding Python coding structure and syntax.

I hope you enjoy these assignments.
